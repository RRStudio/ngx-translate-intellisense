- Write the desired text you want translated
- Select it, and execute the `Create translation from selection` command
- A snake_case key will be generated for you, but you can change it to whatever you want
- Press the enter key to confirm the creation
- Open the translation files to see your new translation :)

### Translations editor

- Open the translations view either by using the provided `Translations Editor` activity bar view, or by executing the `Open translations editor` command

- The editor displays all your translations in a table, order by `Key` -> `Languages`, and will update automatically when changes to the translation files are made
  - If this is not the case, to fix this issue either click the `Refresh` button or execute the `Update translations` command
- You can now live edit all translation keys and values. `NOTE: empty values wlil be marked in red`
- To create a new entry, click the `+ New` button at the bottom of the table
